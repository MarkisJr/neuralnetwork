# Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Created by myself to study the applications and build process of Networks.

### Features of this Network:
- Scalable: Input values, hidden neuron and outputs can all be customised to any double value
- Lightweight: Uses little processing power and executes readily and rapidly
- Independent: Free of any external libraries and packages, can be run stand-alone


### Cons of this Network:
- Lacks GUI: Possible coming in the future...
- Lacks comments: I made this by looking at multiple sources and articles hence its chopped and spliced from different perspectives and programming habits

# Plans for the Future

As this network infrastructure is further developed and expanded more projects will come and improvements will be made.
